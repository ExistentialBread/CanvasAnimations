Hi, this is my animation project. There are two animations available, snow and rain.
It relies on HTML Canvas in order to run these animations.
Most of the code is in the "public" folder.

To Run:
If you don't have Node installed, you'll need that first
If you have don't have express installed, then you can run "npm install" at the top level folder
After the downloads, simply run "node app.js" at the top level folder, and navigate to 
"http://localhost:3000/" in a browser to see the project.

Also you can run the code by opening "ezRun/index.html" in the browser.
